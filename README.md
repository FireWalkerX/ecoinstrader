I purchased this from the dev and he was supposed to make upgrades. We would agree on a price and a timeline but he kept asking for more and more money. When I figured out this guy works and after paying in advance, he refused to complete the job wanting more money and leaving me in the lurch. 
While his work is good, he cannot be trusted or counted on.  Now I find out he has a bad rep on bitcointalk.org as a scammer.

I bought it with full rights and now I offer this to the community as an open source project. We can all improve it and share!
